# Chimp 'n Beats

This project is a music recommending app built with JavaScript and utilizes Spotify's web API. Check it out at: https://chimp-n-beats.vercel.app.

## Functionality

This app connects to the end user's Spotify account and retrieves the user's top 50 songs from the past few weeks. This data is then used to generate 50 recommended tracks and a playlist is created with these suggestions.

Currently, this app is in Development Mode under Spotify. This means that only Spotify accounts that I whitelist can actually log into my app and make use of it. I'm in the process of getting a Quota Extension so that this app will be available for use by the public.
